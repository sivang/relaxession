Relaxession 0.9
===============

Relaxession is a set of Python scripts and modules to enable fault tolerant shared storage across public WAN discrete
nodes or data centers. Relaxession entails automatic health monitoring of CouchDB replication.


Relaxession also makes heavy use of CouchDBKit, which is at the time
only available through Python's easy_install:

$ curl -O http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py
$ sudo python ez_setup.py -U setuptools
$ sudo easy_install -U Couchdbkit

After that, make sure you have autossh installed or install
it using your OS's packaging system. (Relaxession uses it for SSH tunnel keepalive)

How To Run:
-----------

- Copy all the .py files to a desired deployment folder.
- Copy the file 'find_local_ip.pl' to /root on the deployed server.
- Edit configuration.py to your needs and server scheme.
  The configuration file includes inline documentation for the
  various options.
- Make sure you have 'screen' on the running machine, if not
  just install it using your OS's package system.
- After all is set up enter this commands to run it in the background using screen:
  sivan@sivan-desktop:~$ screen
  sivan@sivan-desktop:~$ ./connmanager.py
  (Then hit CTRL-(A+D) to detach from the session)
  Relaxession's ConnectionManager is running and taking care of health of
  replication connections. 

  Relaxation time is now.
